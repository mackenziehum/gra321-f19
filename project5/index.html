    <h1>Modern Graphic Design: Directions and Purpose</h1> 
    <h2>What is graphic design?</h2>
        <p>As we mentioned in one of our previous articles about the issue, graphic design can be described as the sphere of human activity that lies on the crossroads of several directions, first of all, visual arts, communication and psychology. Basically, graphic designers do the job of communication to others by means of graphic (visual) elements such as images of different style and complexity, types and fonts, pictograms, shapes and sizes, colors and shades, lines and curves etc. Graphic designer makes all those elements of visual perception transfer the message, so he makes them functional. Therefore, we could say that graphic designers are artists applying their talents mostly not in pure art but communicating and purposeful art.</p>
        <p>Modern graphic design broadly covers all spheres of human life which deal with visual communication, from books and posters to sophisticated mobile applications or 3D animation. Let’s look into directions in which graphic designers can express their creativity for the sake of solving problems and satisfying needs.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, graphic design is an incredibly broad sphere for application of artistic talents. In particular, it includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>editorial design</li>
                <li>illustration</li>
                <li>identity (logo and branding) design</li>
                <li>icons and pictograms</li>
                <li>typography</li>
                <li>interface graphics and elements</li>
                <li>print advertisements</li>
                <li>big print items such as posters and billboards</li>
                <li>signs</li>
                <li>packaging etc.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Thus, it’s easily seen that modern designers in this sphere have multiple options to apply their talents. In all the mentioned directions, the basic purpose of graphic design is to serve a particular purpose or even a set of them by means and techniques of art.</p>
        <p>Graphic design in modern life full of digital devices is getting more and more technological. Famous Italian designer Massimo Vignelli said “The life of a designer is a life of fight. Fight against the ugliness. Just like a doctor fights against disease. For us, the visual disease is what we have around, and what we try to do is cure it somehow with design.” Remembering the words we have to say that the purposes of modern graphic design are pushed further and further. Not only does it beautify the physical or digital object, but also helps its users, navigates them, guides their way via which they can get both aesthetic pleasure and problem-solving benefits.</p>
